I lead teaching of Java and Digital Music courses to a groups of children (including those with special needs). Engaging them in the work and the curriculum effectively through presenting, demonstrating and communicating. It was ensured that each child was actively involved with the learning and that no one was left behind by engaging with each on a one to one level. Simultaneously, time had to be managed effectively so that the full curriculum was taught in the space of a week. Engaging in disciplinary matters within the class in order that schedules are kept to and arriving in time to set up required equipment.
