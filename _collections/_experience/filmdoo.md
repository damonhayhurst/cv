<!--full-description-->

FilmDoo, is a UK-based video-on-demand startup that specialises in independent and world cinema.

Member of the product development team for Filmdoo’s edutainment venture. I was responsible for the R&D on the tech stack that the new product was going to use. I took into consideration the business requirements of the product and scalability when designing the architecture of the product. I carried out the foundational full stack development for the product including developing the data structure and defining the front end component hierarchy.

I worked on the development of Filmdoo’s user upload feature that would be part of the main site. I created an endpoint that would receive chunked video data and upload it to AWS using the S3 API. The front end was developed using jQuery. A large part of the project was usability research and testing. I performed extensive research on VOD competitors to define patterns which Filmdoo could use for it’s UX all while being coherent with the rest of the site.
