Crunch provides online accountancy services for small businesses and self-employed people.

Undertook the development of the core Spring app, developing various features intended to improve the client manager’s ability to handle issues that their client may be having with the app. I created Python scripts that would automate updating the database.

I also was a member of the team developing Crunch’s single sign on technology within a microservice architecture. Responsible for creating MySQL queries that would collate data to uncover client issues and also design MySQL procedures that would fix more widespread issues. I also introduced and implemented a unit testing framework, MyTap, for these procedures.
